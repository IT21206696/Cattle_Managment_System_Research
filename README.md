   - Used for disease detection and image-based analysis.  
2. **Random Forest**:  
   - Applied for classification tasks and predictive analytics.
  

## Data Collection and Preprocessing  

### 1. Data Collection  
- **Farm Data**  
  - Collected from the farm's administrative officer, including breed, age, health records, milk yield, feeding patterns, and GPS locations.  
  - Data is stored in a structured format (e.g., Excel or CSV) for easy analysis.  

- **Kaggle Images**  
  - Relevant datasets were downloaded from Kaggle for tasks such as breed identification and pest/disease recognition.  
  - Images were labeled accurately to ensure data quality.  

- **Supplementary Data**  
  - External datasets and APIs were used to gather information on nutritional requirements for different cattle breeds.  

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing  

#### A. Cleaning  
- **Handle Missing Data:**  
  - For numeric values (e.g., weight, milk yield), missing values were filled using statistical methods such as mean or median.  
  - For categorical variables (e.g., breed, disease status), the mode or a special category ("Unknown") was used.  

- **Remove Duplicates:**  
  - Duplicate entries were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.  

- **Correct Data Entry Errors:**  
  - Data was validated for consistency, such as verifying GPS coordinates and ensuring accurate entries.  

#### B. Transformation  
- **Normalization and Scaling:**  
  - Data was normalized or scaled (e.g., Min-Max Scaling) to prepare for machine learning models.  

- **Encoding Categorical Data:**  
  - Categorical variables (e.g., cattle breed) were converted to numerical representations using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.  

#### C. Preprocessing Images for ML Models  
- **Resizing Images:**  
  - All images were resized to consistent dimensions (e.g., 224x224) using libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.  

- **Image Augmentation:**  
  - Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping were applied to expand the dataset and reduce overfitting.
